# The Random Walk Model  

Whenever the time series data follow a random walk, the Naive model can be employed (termed also a Random Walk model). For a random walk, the current observation is equal to the previous observation with a step randomly up, or down. It is related to a White Noise series in that it composes a sum of elements from a discrete white noise series.
